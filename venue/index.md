#### Holden Manz

Holden Manz Wine Estate is located above the Franschhoek valley overlooked by magnificent mountains which stand guard over the beautiful valley below. Situated between the Franschhoek & Stony Brook rivers, this 22 hectare wine estate will be the venue for our wedding.

The wedding service will be conducted outside, amongst the vines. Drinks and lawn games to follow beside the vineyard, and then dinner and dancing in the main restaurant.

Since Holden Manz is a working wine farm, we'd recommend flat shoes for the ladies (heels might get stuck in the grass).
